        <h3>App Discription</h3>
        <p>There are two apps that i will be working on. The first one will be a weather app where someone will have 
            to only input their zipCode to get the weather information.

            The second one will be a todo app where one can input what they want to do for that day and after they have done it,
            then they can clear everything from the tab and plan new task of the day.

        <h4>Site Catchphrase</h4>
        <p>Liberia has two seasons, dry and rainy seasons but the dry season is always very hot and dry, most people prefer this season as they are free to go about having fun
            but at times it rain a lot during the dry season so people get confuse about the wether condition in catine part of the country.
